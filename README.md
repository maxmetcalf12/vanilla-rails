# README

This is the basic preferred rails app according to Max Metcalf.

## Decisions
* Use webpacker for Javascript packages
* Use turbolinks
* Use webpacker for css and Tailwind CSS
* Use AlpineJS as default javascript framework

## Scaffold
This example adds a single scaffold for Person with first_name, last_name, and email -- just to show how forms should work.
We use ActionText to add rich content to this model
